# Cheapest 'Mods' To Do
*Look, so long as you aren't worried about tanking the retail value of your vehicle, go ahead with any or all of these.*

So, if you're on a budget here's a list of cheap shit you can do to your car to make it your own.

### Spray Paint Paintjob
##### *~$200*
Starting off really strong, here's something no respectable content creator would be advising, but just off my username you should know that isn't who I am. Anyway, wraps and paintjobs go for around $1-3k at least, here you'll get away with spending under $200. I've seen some actually pretty solid finishes done with spray cans, and even just changing up the wheels is enough to make some cars look pretty good. 
**Steps:**
1. Cover and tape off everywhere you don't want to paint.
2. Sand off the current paint job. You'll want to be careful with this and I'd advise taking your time and doing it by hand (I've tried spinning it with a drill, would not suggest).
3. (Kinda Optional) Some people say you should use a primer or a base coat, but others say you can get away without it. I'm in the middle with that you should prime any exposed metal or bondo, but definitey not the whole car, that'd just add years (and $) to an already pretty bad idea.
4. Get to spraying. Grab your paint of choice (Rust-Oleum multi-purpose is my fav), and spray light coats from 4ish inches away. Take your time, letting each coat dry before doing the next one, and make sure you have a ton of cans to go through. If you're just doing tires you can just do this step with something like Dupli-color wheel coating. If you're doing just tires you could also do grilles, vents, and badges with an accent colour. If you've ever done your nails with base and colour its a lot like that.
5. (Optional) Again, some argue you should do another clear coat overtop to protect your paint. Here in western Canada I have no fucking clue what the fuckers from above will throw at us so I do a whole extra clear coat to try and dissuade my 'artistry' from evaporating.

### RGB Everywhere
##### *~$200*
Its cheap, its easy to do, and you can always just turn it off or rip it off. I think I've written a solid piece on this [over here](https://github.com/AutozoneTwink/How-and-Should-you-Install-RGB). But I'd just sum it up as grabbing some light strips (waterproof if on outside) and figuring out how to get power cables to them.

### Mirror Decor
##### *~$15*
Throw something cool looking or thats looks symbolic. I've got a pair of actual dice ive drilled holes through to hang off a necklace bit, I think it looks pretty cool and cost me pretty much nothing to make. Also, your car's now going to be a lot more recognizable, at least to you.


### Shift Knobs
##### *~$50*
If you've got a manual you can pretty much just screw off one and toss on a new one from Amazon. Just make sure to check threads and lengths.

### Pedals
##### *~$50*
Only slightly less solely aesthetic than a shift knob, as you can usually get a little bit more grip than the stock pedals. Also, cleaning dirt off of flatter metal tends to be easier than off of the textured plastic you get with stock pedals. Universal pedals from sparco or wherever will fit pretty well on most cars, unless you've got really weirdly shaped ones. 
**Steps:**
1. Clean off old pedals. Don't want any dirt stuck under the new covers.
2. Drill holes through covers and into pedals to attach screws. 
3. Screw in covers and enjoy the new look.

### Mud Flaps
##### *~$50-100*
Whether or not it looks good really depends on personal preference and what your car is built for. I don't recall ever seeing a slammed car looking good (or even needing) mud flaps. But if you've got something more rally or off-road passing like an Evo, WRX, or SUV then they can definitely add to it. Also, if you do take it offroad or get a lot of snow it could be nice to add to your car (I kinda like mud/snow getting thrown up by the windows tho). You'll need a rivet gun for sure, and possibly a drill if you can't get model-specific ones.
**Steps:**
 1. Remove stock mud flap or fender cover.
2. Drill through mud flap plastic where you want to attach it.
3. Rivet through where you've chosen to attach the mud flap.
4. Put everything back together and rip it.

### Fire Extinguisher
##### *~$40*
Maybe I've just seen one two many beloved cars torched, but I see no reason why straping even just a handheld fire exinguisher into your ride is a bad idea. And that way you're one step closer to being race-legal, and it's definitely a talking point if theres one of those in there. Get yourself a mounting kit and a smaller extinguisher from like home depot.

### STICKERS
##### *~$20-...*
Theres no end to the price tag on this one. Just depends what kind of look you're going for, and how much money you're willing to dump into stickers. 
**Steps:**
1. Just make sure you wash the car first.

### Airtag or other tracker
##### *~$40*
Would I absolutely fight someone for my car? 100%! Would I lose? Probably. But if you love your car as much as I do mine you'll understand why it's totally reasonable to want to at least know where some bitch has taken your car. Maybe don't do some fast and furious shit on them, but also maybe do (Idgaf, go get your car back).


### Tow Strap
##### *~$10-30*
Can be a little tough to find the right bolts to fit into the tow hook slot, but a strap looks a lot better and less problematic than a sticky bit out of the bumper. And if you actually want to be able to tow your car with the strap you'll have to pay a bit more. My POS weighs way too much for me to trust any strap to tow it so mines really just cus I like how it looks.
**Steps:**
1. Take in hook that came with car to a bolt supply shop and ask if they have something with the same thread (or scoure forums until you can find someone who knows it).
2. Get a strap online (or make one out of a guitar strap and some knitting thread).
3. Throw the strap over the bolt and screw it into your car.
4. Very likely get called a ricer, and be unable to talk back cus they're kinda right.

If you do any of these best of luck, and be more careful than you think you should be or you'll want to throw a lot of things. Also, feel free to tag me if you post on IG [@autozonetwink](https://www.instagram.com/autozonetwink/) after doing them, love to see stuff like that.
